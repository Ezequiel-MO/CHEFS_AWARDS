      <h1> The story behind CUTT/Events </h1>
      <p>
        CUTT/Events was born as CUTTING EDGE EVENTS in Valencia in 2008, after
        the America's Cup in Valencia, by two entrepreneurs: Montse Miranda and
        Oliver Martinez. Montse and Oliver had been working together since 2002
        in one of the biggest DMCs in Spain. They brought to the company their
        experience in the local market and in big events (such as America's Cup,
        F1, and Standalone congress with Johnson & Johnson for example) as well
        as the care and attention to the client, totally personalized in each
        project. This was the approach we needed to be different from other
        DMCs: everything at CUTT/Events is done "A la carte". Our project is
        strong and has survived despite the adversities: we are still in the
        market after the economic crisis of 2009-2010 and the COVID pandemic.
        Over the years, we have had the opportunity to grow, but we have
        preferred to keep our size small, to continue to give this personalized
        touch to all our events. CUTT & SEE NETWORK: A long collaboration for
        great events When we have large or special projects, we work closely
        with another DMC, SEE NETWORK, a specialist in car launches and
        projects, with a philosophy very similar to ours. CUTT/Events has
        expertise in customer service and group operations (from creative ideas
        to online operations) with more than 20 years of experience in the
        sector... SEE Network subsidiary of Joke Events Gmhb brings the
        multilingual team, and marketing experience, and being the subsidiary in
        Spain of a large company with a presence in Europe and the United States
        can bring. We have been working together for several years, and the most
