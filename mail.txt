Dear Rikki, Dear Imogen,

I hope you are having an amazing start of the year.
It has been a long month worth of hard work, and we are so pleased to finally be able to send our proposal accross to you.

For this project, we decided to involve our IT department, and we have built a dedicated website that we started from scratch.

In order to access the website, please click on the button below. 
You will be directed to an encrypted url that will allow you to access the website safely, without the hassle of going though a login process.

Whenever you want to access the website again, you may simply go back to this email, or keep the url in your browser's bookmarks.

We hope the website is self explanatory, but if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us. 

As for the content of the website - we would like you to pay close attention to the sections in which we explain the rationale behind 
choosing Campo Anibal among the other options, and specially, why we are proposing the Hemisferic as the main venue for the event, as opposed
to the Calle Mayor and Principe Felipe.

When you finish reviewing the website, and after some time to digest the information, we would love to set apart some time to 
discuss the project with you - either on Teams, Google Meet, over the phone or , ...we don't mind at all coming to your office and meet 
in person if you prefer.



Talk soon, and thank you for your time.
